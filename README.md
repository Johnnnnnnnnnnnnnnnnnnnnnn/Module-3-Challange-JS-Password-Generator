# Module-3-Challange-JS-Password-Generator

This is a password generator that has been made using Java Script. It can take user input from prompt. The options that users can choose from are:

1. How many characters they wanted in their password with the minimum of 8 and maximum of 128 characters.
2. If they wanted to include lower case characters or not.
3. if they wanted to include upper case characters or not.
4. if they wanted to include numeric characters or not.
5. if they wanted to include special characters or not.
